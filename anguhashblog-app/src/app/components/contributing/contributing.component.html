      <p>Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature
        requests. Instead, we recommend using <a href="https://github.com/orgs/AnguHashBlog/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussions</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/MZX8Pm6q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> to ask support-related questions.</p>

          <h2>Issues - Features vs Bugs</h2>
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>Not all issues are bug fixes! Please understand the difference between a Feature and a Bug when it comes to
        issue creation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>FEATURE</span> - when you are implementing something new that has not been worked on before</li>
        <li><span>BUG</span> - when you are correcting something that has been worked on before </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Responsiveness - when you start working on responsiveness, if no one has done anything related to
          responsiveness throughout a view or the entire app, then you are working on a feature and not a bug.</li>
      </ul>

          <h2>Submitting an Issue</h2>
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>Before opening an issue, please check the tracker to see if a similar issue has been raised. Existing
        discussions may provide useful insights or workarounds.</p>
      <p>Evaluate whether the Issue is a <span>Feature</span> or a <span>Bug</span> and submit the correct issue type.
        You can file new issues by selecting from our new issue templates and filling out the issue template.</p>
      <p>To expedite bug fixes, a minimal reproduction of the issue is required. This concise example helps in swiftly
        identifying and addressing the problem.</p>
      <p>Providing a minimal reproduction is crucial for saving time, increasing the chances of a quick resolution, and
        ensuring that focus is given to the correct issue.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>DO NOT erase the provided issue template! It is intended for you to use, not to replace it with random text.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>It is always a good practice to look up existing issues and ensure your new issue matches the established
        format. This helps maintain consistency and makes it easier for others to understand and collaborate on the
        issue.</p>

          <h2>'Needs Triage' issue label</h2>
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p> Every new issue is tagged with the "needs triage" label, signifying that it requires review and assessment by
        a core team member. This process ensures that issues are appropriately prioritized and assigned, fostering a
        collaborative environment where tasks are synchronized to prevent conflicts. While you focus on addressing an
        issue, it's important to recognize that others may be working on related tasks. Therefore, the "needs triage"
        label serves as a precautionary measure, indicating that the issue is not yet ready for immediate attention. The
        issue will be ready to work on, once the "needs triage" label is removed.</p>

          <h2>Standardization Across App Versions</h2>
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>All app versions maintain consistent file structures, functionalities, and feature implementations deliberately. The variations between versions are minimal, primarily revolving around the utilization of UI components where a UI library is used.</p><p>Once an issue has been resolved in one app version, the same implementation must be extended to all other versions, unless a superior alternative is proposed.</p><p> Any new implementation suggestion must be discussed to verify they are suitable for adoption across all app versions.</p>

        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>Before commencing work on any issue, it is essential to confirm that it has not already been addressed. Utilize the <a routerLink="/issue-picker">Issue Picker</a> tool to check for existing implementations and their corresponding app versions. If the chosen issue has already been resolved in a different app version, consult the Issue Picker to review the existing implementation and replicate it accordingly.</p>
      <p>Even if the issue is labeled as not implemented, it remains your responsibility to examine the app's codebase and confirm the absence of the issue.</p>

      <p>Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Search <a href="https://github.com/AnguHashBlog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AnguHashBlog</a>
          for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate existing efforts.
        </li>
        <li>Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd
          like to add. Discussing the design upfront helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.</li>
        <li><a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fork</a> the AnguHashBlog repo of your choice.</li>
        <li>In your forked repository, make your changes in a new git branch:
          <pre><code>git checkout -b my-fix-branch develop</code></pre>
          <p>The default branch is develop</p>
        </li>
        <li>Create your patch, including appropriate test cases.</li>
        <li>Follow the Coding Standards</li>
        <li>Run the full test suite, as described in the developer documentation, and ensure that all tests pass.
        </li>
        <li>Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message following the Commit Message Guidelines
          <pre><code>git commit --all</code></pre>
          <p>Note: the optional commit --all command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Push your branch to GitHub:
          <pre><code>git push origin my-fix-branch</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>In GitHub, send a pull request to <span>AnguHashBlog/angular:develop</span></li>

      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <h3>Components</h3>
      <p>Store full components that can be used on their own, in the components folder, examples include:</p>
      <p>‚Ä¢ header, footer, posts, series, post-details, layout, sidenav</p>
      <h3>Partial Components</h3>
      <p>Place partial components like dialogs and other smaller reusable components, in the partials folder, examples:
      </p>
      <p>‚Ä¢ settings-dialog, follow-dialog, search-dialog, svg-icon</p>
      <h3>Interfaces</h3>
      <p>Keep interfaces in the models folder, examples:</p>
      <p>‚Ä¢ blog-info.ts, post.ts</p>
      <p>‚Ä¢ Avoid duplicating existing interfaces or importing them in the wrong file.</p>
      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>Place services in the services folder, examples:</p>
      <p>‚Ä¢ blog.service.ts, theme.service.ts</p>
      <h3>Custom - Pipes, Directives</h3>
      <p>Custom pipes to be placed in the pipes folder</p>

        <mat-panel-title>
          <h2>Coding Standards</h2>
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For dialogs, ensure the inclusion of the term dialog in the name.</li>
        <li>Maintain consistency with established naming conventions in other app versions.
        </li>
        <li>Propose suggestions for improved and clearer naming in discussions or comments.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Style Guide</h3>
      <p>The project utilizes SCSS. Copying and pasting CSS from other sources would be accepted only if it is formatted
        correctly to comply with SCSS conventions.</p>
      <p>use relative measurements in the scss files:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>rem, %</li>
        <li>wh, vh, dvw dvh</li>
        <li>avoid using px</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Media queries</h3>
      <p>The placement for media queries is the standard placement - below all the other styles.</p>
      <h3>Indentation & Formatting</h3>
      <p>Maintain the project's indentation and formatting. Do not include formatting changes in your PRs, only include
        code that you have changed. It doesn't look like you have done more when you submit a PR with tons of
        indentation changes - we all see its just indentation and that makes it even more unpleasant to deal with.</p>
