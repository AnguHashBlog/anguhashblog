But remember, if you ask a maintainer something that's already covered in the docs, it shows them right away that you didn't bother reading. And that's not the best first impression. So, yeah, check out the docs first!",

      "description": "Open source maintainers are often experienced developers who not only write code and develop projects but also create documentation, develop live sites, handle deployment, track and document issues, conduct code reviews, and assist collaborators within the project's scope. There are cases where maintainers may not directly contribute code, but they still engage in various activities. It's important to verify before assuming their responsibilities. Typically, maintainers are heavily involved in code writing, and you can gain more insights by exploring the repository's analytics."

This tactic may be tempting for inexperienced developers, but experienced developers can easily detect it and will be frustrated by such behavior. Such actions will leave a negative impression and undermine trust within the project's community. This is just one example, but avoid engaging in any of those silly cheap tricks, as you are not fooling anyone."
